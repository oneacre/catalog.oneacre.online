        <p>“New media—we are told—exist at the bleeding edge of obsolescence. We thus forever try to catch up, updating to remain the same”, wrote Wendy Chung in Updating to Remain the Same: Habitual New Media in 2016. Karina Zavidova wrote
          Artificial Intelligence Never Has A Headache as her bachelor thesis in 2016, and saw that bleeding age up close. Now in 2018 she is revisiting the original text, so many things have been updated, so many things have remained the same, yet
          her mode of existence has not.</p>
        <p>Following all the developments in digital technology Karina Zav- idova often feels overwhelmed and starts comparing herself to an AI implementation. As a data-driven lifestyle emerges, a human body is being viewed as a set of parameters
          not only by scientists, but also by us, ordinary individuals. The fear of AI comes from a concept that AI is a competitor to a human intelligence, and therefore may be superior to it. As citizens of a tech-savvy first world, we are afraid
          of being run over by another species.[removed: But in fact, we are not comparable.] [added: But why do we feel inclined to compare and compete?]</p>
        <p>The publication imagines a possible future format for tech related theory which — with the constant updates of technology— tend to see the edge of obsolescence straight out of the publisher’s door. Borrowing from version technologies and
          software lingo, the publication explores what an edition would mean or look like when it occurs as often as update rollups. Over the next couple months, the author will keep a leisurely eye on the publication making sure it remains updated
          and “running”, as one would do upkeeping a plug in.</p>

        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p><a href="http://zavidova.com/">Karina Zavidova</a> (RU) is a graphic designer, media artist and researcher. She obtained a bachelor degree in Graphic Design from the KABK (Royal Academy of Art, The Hague) in July 2016. She is working with
          topics such as the
          intervention of digital technology in human bodies and the emotional bonds of users with their devices. Deeply fascinated by opposites that behave like each other – the artificial, developing organically; the digital, having physical
          properties; the human, mechanising herself. Manifest in her research and writing as she develops her own poetic language and systems of metaphors, approaching design as storytelling.</p>
